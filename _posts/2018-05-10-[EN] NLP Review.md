>In this articles, I will cover a few good articles that I found on the internet. The goal is to orgnize the resources and notes in the process of learning NLP. The followings are the index of the article.

1. Pre-requirments - Suggest what kinds of knowledge are recommanded to gain before starting NLP task
2. Resources - The resources that I used to learn NLP
3. Read-Papers - I will show a short summary for the papers I read before. Some will have detailed introduction articles
4. Concepts - I would like to collect some important concepts related to NLP tasks in this section
5. Implementation - In order to make these theories into real work, what kinds of knowledge do we need.
6. Experiment Results - In this section, I will show the experiments that I made before.

Why I am writting this article in English? It's because of terminology. I prefer to directly using the original English term to specify the concept or word. Also, Writing in English will be easy to be shared in the world.

Let's get started!

1. PRML
2. Speech and Language Processing

Also, in NLP, there are also a lot of math, mostly probability. So I will recommand to review this textbook

And here I am listing some famous papers in NLP. The most possibly related region is shown on the subtitle. Also, I tend to collect all related paper(or let's say variations) together

Let's take a look:

- [Attention Model, Machine Translation]: NEURAL MACHINE TRANSLATION BY JOINTLY LEARNING TO ALIGN AND TRANSLATE
- [LDA Topic Model, Summarisation]: 
- [Word Embedding, Tagging, Labelling]:
- [Recurrent Dropout, Tagging, Labelling]:
- [LexRank, Keyword Extraction]:
	- [TextRank]: 
- [Keyword Extraction]:
- [LSTMs]:

Also, I watched a series of courses about ML and DL in coursera.

- Machine Learning(by Andrew Ng)
- Deep Learning specialty(by Andrew Ng)

Lastly, when I seek information in the internet, I have found many useful articles. For English:

and for chinese(both tradional and simplified):

For datasets, since I am doing comments summarisation, There are some available datasets on the internet.
