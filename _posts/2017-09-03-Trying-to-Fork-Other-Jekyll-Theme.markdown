# Trying to Fork Other Jekyll Theme

Today I tried to utilize others' existed theme. However, I find it is a little bit hard to use.
Since the theme is designed for **photographer** and **writter**, it doesn't take many situations into account such as showing codes.
You could compare these two styles below.

![Trophy](\assets\img\trophy.png ){: width="300"}
![Minima](\assets\img\minima.png ){: width="300"}

If I want to make custom settings on my own, it's still available. 
I could set the `sass folder`, since I have already changed some settings. However, it's still a little bit troublesome.

Therefore, I think this minima theme is more suitable for me, and all I need is to add some extra functions.
For examples:
1. Discussion Zoom.
2. Categorize the articles.
3. Personal Description.

Then, I will keep exploring and testing the function of markdown everyday.
