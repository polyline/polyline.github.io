<h1 id="first-shot">First Shot</h1>
<p>Iâ€™m trying to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Github Pages</code> combined with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Jekyll</code> to create my blog.
Although I succeeded, and the blog is online right now, I am still not sure if I knew how it operates.</p>

<h1 id="review-of-my-wrok">Review of My Wrok</h1>
<p>Here to review what I did to create this simple-style blog.
Actually, Jekyll provides many themes for us to choose, And What I use right now is called <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima"><code class="highlighter-rouge">minima</code></a>.</p>

<p>To begin, you have to own a github account, in order to use github page.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaKX4A5EiQoa">Here is a video for you get a quick start</a>.</p>

<p>After that, follow the instruction on the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> website.</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem install jekyll bundler
jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
bundle exec jekyll serve
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>You could easily install Jekyll in your computer.</p>

<p>Then you could run your website on local host by this command:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll serve
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>The default port is 4000. If you want to change it. you could change the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config</code> file.</p>

<p>Finally, you could have a simple website.
Whenever you want to add a new post, the only thing you have to do is to add a new <strong>markdown file</strong> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_post</code> folder.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>To conclude it, there are some important points in this process.</p>
<ol>
  <li>How to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">github</code>.</li>
  <li>Install jekyll and understand the command of Jekyll.</li>
  <li>Learn the grammary of markdown.</li>
  <li>Knowing that <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config</code> file and <code class="highlighter-rouge">front-matter</code> variables.</li>
</ol>

<p>And then what I am going to know is to to figure out the structure of Jekyll further and how to make changes on this existed structure. If I want to change some contents of it, what should I do.
For examples, if I want to add a list to categorize my articles.</p>

<p>Trying to use some mathematic symbols here.
