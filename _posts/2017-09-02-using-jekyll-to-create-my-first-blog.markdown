# First Shot
I'm trying to use `Github Pages` combined with `Jekyll` to create my blog.
Although I succeeded, and the blog is online right now, I am still not sure if I knew how it operates.

# Review of My Wrok
Here to review what I did to create this simple-style blog.
Actually, Jekyll provides many themes for us to choose, And What I use right now is called [`minima`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

To begin, you have to own a github account, in order to use github page.
[Here is a video for you get a quick start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaKX4A5EiQoa).

After that, follow the instruction on the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) website.
```
gem install jekyll bundler
jekyll new my-awesome-site
cd my-awesome-site
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
You could easily install Jekyll in your computer.

Then you could run your website on local host by this command:
```
jekyll serve
```
The default port is 4000. If you want to change it. you could change the `_config` file.

Finally, you could have a simple website.
Whenever you want to add a new post, the only thing you have to do is to add a new **markdown file** in the `_post` folder.

# Conclusion
To conclude it, there are some important points in this process.
1. How to use `git` and `github`.
2. Install jekyll and understand the command of Jekyll.
3. Learn the grammary of markdown.
4. Knowing that `_config` file and `front-matter` variables.

And then what I am going to know is to to figure out the structure of Jekyll further and how to make changes on this existed structure. If I want to change some contents of it, what should I do.
For examples, if I want to add a list to categorize my articles.

Trying to use some mathematic symbols here.
