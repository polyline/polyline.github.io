<h1 id="trying-to-fork-other-jekyll-theme">Trying to Fork Other Jekyll Theme</h1>

<p>Today I tried to utilize others’ existed theme. However, I find it is a little bit hard to use.
Since the theme is designed for <strong>photographer</strong> and <strong>writter</strong>, it doesn’t take many situations into account such as showing codes.
You could compare these two styles below.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\trophy.png" alt="Trophy" width="300" />
<img src="\assets\img\minima.png" alt="Minima" width="300" /></p>

<p>If I want to make custom settings on my own, it’s still available. 
I could set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">sass folder</code>, since I have already changed some settings. However, it’s still a little bit troublesome.</p>

<p>Therefore, I think this minima theme is more suitable for me, and all I need is to add some extra functions.
For examples:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Discussion Zoom.</li>
  <li>Categorize the articles.</li>
  <li>Personal Description.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then, I will keep exploring and testing the function of markdown everyday.</p>
